                <h3>Penalty Kick Prediction</h3>
                <p class="project-status">Completed</p>
                <p>The penalty kick is one of the most dramatic events that can occur in a soccer game. 
                    It can be the source of heartbreak or the source of glory for millions of fans. <br>
                    <br>
                    With an event that can be game defining, only around 17.5% of penalties are saved. 
                    Coaches have long made the hypothesis that the direction the kicker will shoot the 
                    penalty kick can be predicted based on their body movements prior to the shot. <br>
                    <br>
                    Here we tested the hypothesis: Are we able to determine the direction of a penalty shot 
                    based on the kicker's body movements before they make contact with the ball? </p>

                <h3>Sneaker Sentiment Analysis & Price Forecasting</h3>
                <p class="project-status">Completed</p>
                <p>Sneakers have evolved from simple footwear to cultural icons, fueling a multi-billion-dollar 
                    resale market where hype and scarcity drive prices sky-high. This project taps into that 
                    phenomenon by scraping sneaker data from StockX and analyzing community reactions on Reddit 
                    to build a rich dataset.<br>
                    <br>
                    It includes four main analyses: correspondence analysis of sneaker 
                    attributes, price prediction using historical StockX data and Google Trends, and text analysis 
                    of Reddit comments to gauge popularity and sentiment. <br>
                    <br>
                    By combining quantitative and qualitative 
                    insights, the project aims to uncover trends and predict resale prices—key factors for 
                    collectors, resellers, and brands navigating the modern sneaker economy.</p>
